# in that case
```scala
import java.util.{HashMap => JavaHashMap}
import scala.collection.mutable._
```
* _HashMap_ is a _scala.collection.mutable.HashMap_
* and JavaHashMap is a _java.util.HashMap
# But if you don't want to use 
* the _java.util.HashMap_
* but all of the others classes of the _java.util_ package
```scala
import java.util.{HashMap => _, _} //all others classes than HashMap of the java.util package
import scala.collection.mutable._
``` 
* The first **=>_** 
  * hides a member instead of renaming it 
  * If I want to rename (_ is then replaced by the name of the replacing class) ...
