## What a package can contains
* classes
* objects
* traits
### But not
* variable defintion
* function definition
## package object the exception (p 84)
* very useful to define variable in a package
* the object name is the suffix of the package name !!!
* the example of p 84 is a case of a flat package !!!
```scala
package com.horstmann.impatient2 //I called it impatient2 because impatient is already used and has priority

package object people {
  val defaultName = "John Q. Public"
}

package people {
  class Person {
    var name:String = defaultName
  }
}
```
* in the Main class:
```scala
object Main extends App {
    val p = new com.horstmann.impatient2.people.Person
    println(s"Hello World ${p.name}")

    val the_package_name: String = com.horstmann.impatient2.people.defaultName

    println(s"Hello World directly from package ${the_package_name}")
}
```
* The Package object is compiled to a Java class (com.horstmann.impatient.people.package) with a _static defaultName_ field
* Follow the warnings put the package into a file with the following path _com/horstmann/impatient/people/package.scala_
  * that makes people easier to retrieve your code   !!!! 
* This [Post StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52120496/scala-package-object-v-s-singleton-object-within-a-package) explains the difference between an object and a package object !!!
