* Top of fle notation makes IntelliJ thinks the package name does not match the path.
* Good Point for every package The class Icon is replaced by he more general Icon
* We can call the _Employee_ class inside 

```scala
package com.horstmann.impatient
package people
class Person {
  val p = new Employee
}
```

* because it belong to a parent package (we don't need to import the package)
```scala
package com {
  package horstmann {
    object Utils {
      def percentOf(value: Double, rate: Double): Double = value * rate / 100
    }


    package impatient { //child of the horstmann package

      import scala.collection.mutable

      class Employee {
        var salary: scala.Double = 0.0

        def giveRaise(rate: scala.Double): Unit = {
          salary += Utils.percentOf(salary, rate)
        }
      }

      class Manager {
        val subordinates = new _root_.scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Employee]
      }
    }

  }
}
```
