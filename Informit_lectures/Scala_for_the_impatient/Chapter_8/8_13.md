# Value Classes
* To play with Companion object and private constructor
  * it cannot be done in the Scala REPL
  * because the class and its ompnion object must reside in the same package
```scala
package miltime

class MilTime private (val time:Int) extends AnyVal {
  def minutes = time % 100 // the two last digits are the minutes
  def hours:Int = time / 100 // The two first digit (il more than two digit) are tje hours
  override def toString: String = f"$time%04d"
}
object MilTime {
  def apply(t:Int) =
    if (0<= t && t < 2400 && t%100 < 60) new MilTime(t) // between 0 and 24 hours and the minutes number not greater than 59
    else throw new IllegalArgumentException()
}

object Main extends App {
  val lunch = MilTime(1230) //12:30 a.m does exist
  println(lunch.hours)
  println(lunch.minutes)
  val doesnotexists = MilTime(1290) //12:90 a.m. does not exists
}
