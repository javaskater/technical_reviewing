## REPL Helps !!!
* If I want to get an object form an abstract class, the Scala REPL, immediatly constructs an anonymouns Subclass with the concrete abstract method to be completed (no more abstract)
```scala
scala> abstract  class Person(val name:String){
     | def id:Int //No method body - this is an abstract method
     | }
scala> val p = new Person("MENA") {
   override def id: Int = 2 //THe REPL proposes this anonymous Subclass with the abstact method to be made concrete
 }
scala> p.id
val res1: Int = 2
```
* he methods don't need to ba called abstract, they simply have no body
  * but the class has to b declared abstract !!!
* I make an Employe as a oncree subclass of Person
```scala
scala> class Employe(name:String) extends Person(name) {
     | def id:Int = name.hashCode
     | }
class Employe

scala> val e = new Employe("MENA")
val e: Employe = Employe@2ed84be9

scala> e.id
val res2: Int = 2362699
```

* same thing with abstract fields, when I instance the abstract class the REPL creates an anonymous subclass
```scala
scala> abstract class Person {
     | val id:Int //No initializer, th is an abstract field with a getter method
     | var name:String //No initializer, th is an abstract field with a getter method
     | }
class Person

scala> val p2 = new Person {
   override val id: Int = 222
   override var name: String = "MENA"
 }
     |      |      | val p2: Person = $anon$1@923bf67

scala> p.getClass.getName
val res3: String = $anon$1
```

> You can always customize an abstract field by using an anonymous type:
