```scala
object Main extends App {
  var p:Person = null;
  p = new Employee("MENA") //getClass.getName points to Employee

  if (p.isInstanceOf[Employee]){
    val s = p.asInstanceOf[Employee];
    s.salary = 233.4f //but p.salary does not work !!!!
    println(p) //uses the Employee method of toString no the Person one and in the toString getClass.getName points to Employee
    if (p.getClass == classOf[Employee]){
      println(f"${p} is in fact an Employee [classOf]");
    }
  }
}
```
* Note that althoug getClass.getName I can only access the overriden methods of the Person class
* For example I cannot access p.salary, I have to
```scala
val s = p.asInstanceOf[Employee];
s.salary = 233.4f //but p.salary does not work !!!!
```
* as __obj.asInstance(C)__ of is je Java equivalent of _(Cl) obj_
## matching avoids all of this :
```scala
p match {
    case employee: Employee => { //process p as an employe
      employee.salary = 555.567f;
      println(f"${p} is in fact an Employee");
    }
    case _ => println(f"$p is not an employee")
  }
```
