# Constructors
* if the contructor's parameter has a val with
  * it means that name is the contructor's parameter
  * but at the same time a member of the class
  * the declaration includes the affectation of the parameter to the member variable
```scala
package com.horstmann.impatient2

class Person (val name:String){
  private[horstmann] def description = s"a person with name ${name} "
  override def toString =  s"${getClass.getName}[name=$name]"
}

class Employee (name:String) extends Person (name){
  var salary: scala.Double = 0.0
  override def toString = f"${super.toString}[salary=$salary%.2f]"
}

class Manager {
  import java.util.{HashMap => _, _}
  import scala.collection.mutable._
  val subordinates = new ArrayBuffer[Employee]
}

object Main extends App {
  val p = new Employee("MENA")
  p.salary = 233.4f
  println(p)
}
```
* note the [formatting of float values](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/scala-cookbook/9781449340292/ch02s10.html) in Strings
  * we have to use f to start a formatted String like in Python 
* to include the main Code the __object__ (and not the _class_) has to extend the __App__ class
