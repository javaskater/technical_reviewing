## multiple initialization on the same line
* In Scala calling
```scala
val Red, Yellow, Green = Value
```
* is the same as
```scala
val Red = Value
val Yellow = Value
val Green = Value
```
* in _Enumeration.scala_
  * we take the list of all the variable names
  * it works because the to_string conversion of the variable is the variable name itself
```scala
protected var nextName: Iterator[String] = _
```
