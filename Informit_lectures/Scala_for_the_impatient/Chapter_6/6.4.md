* Typically, such an apply method returns an object of the companion class
  * for the Array class it returns a _new Array_ object
  * [Here, in the official Scala documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/scala-book/companion-objects.html) a good explaination of companion object and their apply methods !!!
    * the Class and its companion object share the same name
  * in that example the apply method of the companion object does not return the companion object but a nexw instance of the Person class itself!!!
* There is only one companion object:
```scala
cala> abstract class undoableAction(val description: String){

     | def redo:Unit
     | def undo:Unit
     | }
class undoableAction

scala> object DoNothingAction extends undoableAction("Do Nothing"){
     | override def redo(){}
     | override def undo(){}
     | }
scala> val actions = Map("open" -> DoNothingAction, "save" -> DoNothingAction)
val actions: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,DoNothingAction.type] = Map(open -> DoNothingAction$@7210f559, save -> DoNothingAction$@7210f559)
scala> actions.get("save")
val res0: Option[DoNothingAction.type] = Some(DoNothingAction$@7210f559)

scala> actions.get("open")
val res1: Option[DoNothingAction.type] = Some(DoNothingAction$@7210f559) // it has the same object's address as actions.get("save")
```
