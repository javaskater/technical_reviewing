# p 117/167

* the values in bold are the default ones (when the property is not specified)
* along the cross-axis (orthogonal to the main axis) the default value of property _align-items_ is __stretch__ (all columns have the same height)

# p 118/167:
* flex grow: the percentage of growth in the remaining space
  * percentage is calculated _vi/sum(vj)*100_
# p 119/167
* align-self: is very interesting concerns the cross-axis

## remark on flex-wrap property
* brings us back to the container...
## remark on the flex-flow property
* it is a compound property
## justify content property
* It concerns the container (see the prvious table).
# p 120/167
* align-items property concerns the container see Table 4.1
  * flex-start, start, self-start are the same

# p 123/167
* We can use
* For the concrete example see the Table 4.1 at page 117
* the problem that the money parts where non aligned came from an earlier mistake
  * I was in fact adding a top margin depending on the font size because I had
```css
  .stack * + * {
    margin-block-start: 1.5em;
}
  ```
* instead of:
```css
  .stack > * + * {
    margin-block-start: 1.5em;
    }
```
* The button being a block
  * takes the whole with (except for the padding of its container)
  * it is a direct son of a div of class _stack_ (but not the first son)
    * so it has a margin top of 1.5em
    * like the flexbox itself

## What about the lineheight of 0.7 ?

* This [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-tame-line-height-in-css/) explains:
  * _line-height and font-size on an element with the same value will leave extra room above and below the text._
  * it explains that with the use of descenders
    * the characters are a little less that 1em
    * and line-height is what give the real height of the inline element
