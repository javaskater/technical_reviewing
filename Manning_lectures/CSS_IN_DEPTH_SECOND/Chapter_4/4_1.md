* The figure 4.1 is a good summary of the main 4 _features_:
  * Flex container
  * Flex item
  * Main axis
  * Cross axis

## main and cross
* _main axis_ is similar to __inline-axis__
* _cross axis_ is similar to __block axis__

# p 103/167
* _If they were to remain inline, the height they’d contribute to their parent would be derived from their line height—not their padding_
  * with display flex of the parent element the a-blocks are aligned horizontally
* there is no margin, we use flexbox's gap instead.... gap is a flex-box's property so we use at the ul level
# p 104/167
* putting for the last li *margin-left* to **auto** makes that that last tile of the ul (*display flex*) go to the right...
  * *If you were to apply it to the Support menu item instead, it would shift both links to the right*
