# remember the main terms of a flexbox
* Flex container
* Flex item
* Main axis
* Cross axis
# p 105/167
## remark
* flex is not the name of a class, it is a possible attribute of display
## another remark
* the ul naturally adds a bottom margin, to cancel it:
```css
.site-nav {
    display: flex;
    padding: 0.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 0em; /* to cancel the bottom margin */
    list-style-type: none;
    background-color: #5f4b44;
    gap: var(--gap-size);
}
```
* We see it when we set the background color of the tiles to white !!!
* when we set a gap it also applies it to the right of the last tile...

# p 106/167

* when we set the flex properties he sum of the sizes occupies the entire parent container.
  * _Now the two columns grow to fill the space, so together they are the same width as the navbar_
  * flex means flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis
* The case [flex-basis to 0%](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47578958/the-difference-between-flex-basis-auto-and-0-zero) is well
  * shown in the first answer with a code you can try !!!

# p 107/167
* twho flex grow properties of 1 will equally use the remaining space
  * test with 2 divs of flex-basis of 20% and 40% (remaining space 40%)
  * after flex-grow to 1 will those 2 divs share the smae space inside the container ?
* I changed the style.css (see underneath)
  * at the end *column-main* will occupy about 40%+40%/2 = 60%
  * and *column-sidebar* will occupy about 20%+40%/2 = 40%
  * (we have to take the gap = 1.5rem into account)
```css
.column-main{
    flex-basis: 40%;
    flex-grow: 1;
}

.column-sidebar{
    flex-basis: 20%;
    flex-grow: 1;
}
```
* _An item with flex-grow: 2 will grow twice as much as an item with flex-grow: 1_ (sharing the remaining space)
  * _set a flex basis of 0%, so 100% of the container’s width is the remainder_

# p 108/167
* When you omit one of these 3 values the systems sets for you:
  * flex grow factor of 1,
  * flex shrink factor of 1,
  * and a flex basis of 0%

# p 109/167

* the _flex: 66.67%_ is equivalent to _flex: 1 1 66.67%_
* the [MDN official documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex)
  * explains what 1, 2 or 3 values are for ... (very interesting)
* in that case the flex-shrink rates will have to share equally (1 and 1) the 1.5rem of the gap

# p 113/167
* same dimension along the _cross axis_
