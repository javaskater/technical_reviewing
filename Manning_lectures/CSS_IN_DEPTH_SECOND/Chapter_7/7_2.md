# p 230
* To see the style changing I change the color of the *h1* title in the media query
```css
.title > h1 { /* still in the header */
    color: #333;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    margin-block: 0.2em;
    /*text-shadow: 0.5em 0.5em 0.2em green;*/
}
@media (min-width: 560px){
    .title > h1 {
        font-size: 2.25rem;
        color: #b81414;
    }
}
```
* The media query is placed after the tyle to override
  * because the priority is *based on selector specificity or source order*
## the hover media query
* It is realled at the [official media website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media)
  * a clearer explanation is at [this blog](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/guide-hover-pointer-media-queries/)  
# p 235
* the *!important* keyword is meant to avoid worrying about the cascade overriding the color or the background
```css
@media print {
    * {
        color: black !important;
        background: none !important;
    }
}
```
# p 236:
* the large breakpoint overrides default (small breakpoint) and medium breakpoint styles
  * it is the mobile first approach 
# p 238
> Place your media queries after any styles they need to override
* Good remark if you don't do it theis way, the default style will override the media-queried style !
# p 239
* the difference between static and absolute for a diw ([see this page](https://dillionmegida.com/p/static-relative-absolute-fixed-sticky-positions/))
 * static is the default poisitioning of a bloc that mean the positioning following the flow in its parent element
 * what does the *flex: 1;* for the menu item mean ? Look at [that simulator of the flex values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex)

# p 240
* The *max-inline-width* together with the *margin-inline* applies to the container of the grid as with any of other div
* play with  with CTRL+SHIFT+I and those two properties
```css
@media (min-width: 650px){
    .main {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
        gap: 1.5em;
        max-inline-size: 1400px;
        margin-inline: auto;
    }
    
}
```

* différence between html and *:root* the latter is more specific than the former see [the small experiment at the response 136 on that StackOverflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15899615/whats-the-difference-between-css3s-root-pseudo-class-and-html)
