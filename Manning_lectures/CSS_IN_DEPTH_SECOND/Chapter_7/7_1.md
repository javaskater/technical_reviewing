* p 221 the [border-box property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) tells the width to take account the border and the padding (not the margin)
  * it is applied for all elements includin the ones put [before or after](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/::before) 
```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
* clamp is correctly explained on [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/clamp)
  * [here in french](https://www.codeur.com/tuto/css/unite-de-mesure-taille-px-em-rem/) all units that can be used for font sizes
    * rem: root em
    * [svw](https://www.terluinwebdesign.nl/en/css/incoming-20-new-css-viewport-units-svh-lvh-dvh-svw-lvw-dvw/)  
* the [active pseudo class for a link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active) is the class activated when you are maintaining the mous left button while on the link
* the [margin-block property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-block) gives the margin at the block start and the bloc-end of the current block (which is top and botton for the current writing modes)
* test the [text-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) on the h1 to see what it does, on the hero text it has not a big effect.
# the burger-menu
## p 225
* for the menu toogle the with/height of 1em refers to the current font size of 3em: 1x3em
* text-indent: only the firstline is pushed to 5em
* overflow:hidden == I don't see what is out of the 1emx1em square.
* on this [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space) there is a demo of how **white-space nowrap** acts.
* the position absolute is absolute to the enclosing div -1.2em means -1.2 x 3em (3em is the font size: 3 x 18px)
  * for an after and the element the absolute is absolute to the element see [answer 1 of this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60766000/using-absolute-relative-positioning-with-css-pseudo-elements)
    * *::after* is the last son  of *button* (the same with span in the StackOverflow post)
* position basolute left 0 dominates position absolute right 0
  * the parent nav is only a line (all of its content has a absolute position)
## Styling the navigation menu p 228:
* making the padding to zero is enough for making the list styles disappear
  * because they exist outside the screen 
* margin to zero only efecive for the top dans bottom margin
  * the left and right margins are no impacted
  * except if the margin of the ul element is *0 2em* 
## p 229
* *.nav-menu > li > a* if not display:block I cannot use the padding property (it is not usable for a inline element)
* The menu's parent element (<nav id="main-menu" class="menu">) has only aboslute posiioned child elements
  * no relative or inline content so its with mmust be 0
*  the menu in this case is designed mobile-first !!!
*  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> makes the browser does not think you are a desktop only zoomed out 
  * when you are a mobile device (real or simulated)
