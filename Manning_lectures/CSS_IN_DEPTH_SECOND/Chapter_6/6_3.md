# relative posiioning:
* relative positioning can have a top and left thet dispalce the div from the normal flow !
> By default div's are defined with display: block, meaning that they will take the entire available width.
* p 193 here inline or inline block ha no objectif because i is the only element inside a bigger div (nav)
## p 198:
*  div poition abolute with a top = 2.1em puts the div (not the first li element) just underneath the button
  * left with 0 puts the div aligned with the button
* min-inline-size = 100% means 100% of the nav parent div whose with is determined by the button 
* same background-color than the butnon
  * with the top element, it gives the dropdown div impression to be the natural extension of he button
### submenu
* padding-inline-start: 0; puts the text at the beginning of the encloding div (le list styles are placed negatively)
* margin concerns only the uper and lower margin of the ul
  * remember that the encosing div id occupying the necessayr space with a minimu of 100% of the button width 
* _.submenu li + li_ means all the li except the first child
### li > a
* the [diplay block allows to define the size by default 100%](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42709787/using-display-block-with-anchor-tag)
* if I put (the scroller do not appear)
```css
width: 30%;
overflow: auto;
```
* I get the a text reduced to 30% of the submenu width
* same background color than the button's one
* link color nice (#369) !!!
# p 202
* The [after pseudo element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after)

* the closing up arrow is only 0.9 - 0.3 em from the top only to make its base he same as the down arrow
  * We know that the border is 0.3em thick (see comment underneath)
```css
.dropdown-toggle::after{
      content: "";
      position:absolute;
      right: 1em;
      top: 0.9em;
      border: 0.3em solid; /*Thickness of the border that means also of the arrow */
      border-color: black transparent transparent
  }
  .dropdown.is-open .dropdown-toggle::after{
      top: 0.6em;
      border: 0.3em solid;
      border-color: transparent transparent black
  }
```
