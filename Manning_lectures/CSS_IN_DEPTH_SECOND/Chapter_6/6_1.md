# Creating a dialog Box
* HTML5.2 introduces a new dialog box element like explained in this [Blog Post of 2018](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2018/01/meet-the-new-dialog-element/)
# Our dialog Box
## The css of the body
* _100vh_ means 100% of the viewport height
  * _200vh_ means you are two times higher than the viewport, so you force the scrolling on the page.
  * use [Lorem Ipsum](https://fr.lipsum.com/) to add paragraphs of content inside the main element 
## The css of the top-banner
* [MDN does well explain box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)
```css
margin-inline: auto; /*very partical to center content*/
```
* p 188 why does the submit button does close the modal (othing in javascript)
## modal
* the modal-backdrop is inside the modal because it becomes active only when modal had a display:block
  * it is then out of the flow of its parent conainer because of _position: fixed_ and _inset: 0_
* p 191 says:
```
Because a fixed element is removed from the document flow, it no longer affects the
position of other elements on the page. They’ll follow the normal document flow as if it’s
not there, which means they’ll often flow behind the fixed element, hidden from view.
This is usually fine with a modal dialog because you want it to be front and center until
the user dismisses it.
```

* [The different overflow styles with an animation (MDN official docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/overflow)
* the line-height is the multiplicator factor to the font-size...
* the line-hiht is half the font-size to reduce to zero the distance beween the enclosing div and the base line of the font !!!
