# Subgrids
## p 157/167
* the max-inline-size does limit the with of the div
* the margin-inline to auto does center it (same magrin-left as margin-right)
* the h3 margin-block set the upper and the bottom margin to 0
  * for he bottom-margin there is still the upper-margin of the p element
  * p's margin overlap the div container
* the upper margin of readmore's div overlap the down margin o the p included in the noname above div.
## p 158/167
* unsufficiently explained
* [align-self: end](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self)
  * see the simulation
* We have two definitions of _grid-template-rows_
  * the #¢ in case subgrid does not work
  * the #D in case subgrid does work it takes for each row what was defined in .author-bios
* author-bios seems to have defined nothing in my case but card says it divides itself in 3 rows of it _grid-row: span 3;_ of equal height
  * those are 3 rwos of the parent grids, the .card takes 3 1fr rows of the _.author-bios_'s grid.
* on that [official CDN subgrid link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid)
  * the column are in a subgrid of the parent grid
  * the rows are 3 80px tracks
* we see on Firefox that the two following definitions are equivalent
  * (I don't know why)
  * the second definition is for navigators that don't support subgrid
```css
grid-template-rows: subgrid;
grid-template-rows: max-content auto max-content;
```
