# p 148
## autofill
* will use the min version as fr element
  * see [what does autorepeat](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#auto-repeat)
  * that says _then the number of repetitions is the largest possible positive integer that does not cause the grid to overflow the content box_
  * that means that 1fr is the size of the container / max_number_of_image. If I had an image (of mean-with 200px) it will overflow !
* [official definition of the minmax function](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/minmax)
### Good explanation in french
* [good article in french explaining the minmax](https://la-cascade.io/articles/css-grid-comment-fonctionne-minmax)
  * minmax is typically used in grids
  * it shows the behaviour through animation
### Another good explanation (also in french)
* autofill tries to create as many column as possible strting on min value
* [that link](https://formation.webdevpro.net/display-grid/06-minmax-auto-fit-auto-fill.html) details
  * how we pass from __repeat (5, minmax)__ (risk of horizontal scrollbar) to __repeat(autofit, )__ and __repeat(autofill, )__
## dense

* the portflio is the class of the container
  * the class featured is the class of the contained figure element (of size 2 times the size of the standard _.portfolio_ element)

# p 154/167

* The _figure_ elements are placed bottom to bottom
  * but the inside image does not use all the vertical space
  * that is why we put a column flex for the figure container
  * with a flex 1 for the contained image (use all avalaible space because figcaption has a default zero flex)
* as we don't want the image to be distorted we set *object-fit* to **cover** (which will crop a bit the image to mainain the proportions)
