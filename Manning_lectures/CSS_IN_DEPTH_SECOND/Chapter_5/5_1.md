# p 127/167
* _display: grid_ will user all the available screen-width
* fr means fraction unit. same as flex-grow in flexbox
* I test others fr values
```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: 2fr 3fr;
```
* for the row's height, the most little value corresponds to
  * natural box of the row
* fr shares the available space
  * if the first value is 300px the second and third value will divide the resting space
  * *would define a fixed-size column of 300-px followed by a second column that will grow to fill the rest of the available space*
