## calling a double 1fr
* fig 5.10 calls it col for _1fr 1fr_ and repeats it three times

# p 142:
* naming grid-areas is using a convention
  * each "xxx yyy" correspond to a entire row (divided like specified in *grid_template_columns*)
    * this is why we repeat _title_ or _nav_ two times when we want them to appear on the entire line _2fr + 1 fr_
  * *grid-template-areas* property uses a kind of ASCII-ART syntax
  * to place each individual div in a named grid area use the _grid-area_ property
* The grid area names are seen by the Firefox console
