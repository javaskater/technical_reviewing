# different flows

* _When building the layout of a page, you should do so from the outside in_
* I reached the page 73/167

## p 75 logical properties

* [css_tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/inline-size/) explains why inline-size
  * is the width when the language is RTL or LTR
  * is the height when the language is up to bottom
* inline-size applies also for blocks (which are like inline elements except that they go to the next line before and after)

## p 76
* margin-block defines the two other dimensions not covered by margin-inline!
  * that is for RTL or LTR languages the top and he bottom
* max-with see [listing 3_3](https://github.com/CSSInDepth/css-in-depth-2/blob/2nd-edition/ch03/listing-3.3.html)
  * has the side effect that the diw only occupy only the necessary space
  * why without max-with does it occupy the entire _screen-width_?
