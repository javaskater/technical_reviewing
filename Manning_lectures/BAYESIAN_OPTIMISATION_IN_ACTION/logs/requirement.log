INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of torchvision to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install -r bayesian-optimization-in-action/requirements.txt (line 1), -r bayesian-optimization-in-action/requirements.txt (line 13), -r bayesian-optimization-in-action/requirements.txt (line 2) and torch==2.9.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested torch==2.9.1
    botorch 0.6.0 depends on torch>=1.9
    gpytorch 1.6.0 depends on torch>=1.9
    torchvision 0.24.0 depends on torch==2.9.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
