# 61 CARET 
* the variable in  *chapter4/node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss* is at pôsition 370
  * the position 337 in the text corresponds to the *chapter4/node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss* file without the comments
* the [index.html file to display the Caret is on GitHub](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Missing-Bootstrap-5-Guide/blob/main/part-1/chapter-4/options/caret/index.html)
* simplified the bootstrap.scss to include only the strict necessary (see my [Style.scss to test the carret](./files/style_caret.scss))
* for the bootstrap Javascript file, take if from the dist/js and not from the js/dist (you would not find it)
* # 63
* the [index.html file to test the rounded corners is on GitHub](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Missing-Bootstrap-5-Guide/blob/main/part-1/chapter-4/options/rounded/index.html)
