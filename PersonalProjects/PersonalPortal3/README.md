# Development architecture
## Docker
* This portal has to be developped in a [dockerised Symfony Environment](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/docker.html)
## Mysql or SQLite
* My personal datas are no more static, but in a Mysql/SQLite Database
  * this to make it easy adding removing information 
## GitLab/GitHub
* This is [Personal Portal GitLab.com Repository](https://gitlab.com/jpmena/peronal_portal_3#)
  * name it origin 
* create a similar [GitHub repository]() (todo)
  * name it public
